; NAME:
;    FSC_BASE_FILENAME
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;    The purpose of this is to extract from a long file path, the
;    base file name. That is, the name of the actual file without
;    the preceeding directory information or the final file extension.
;    The directory information and file extension can be obtained via
;    keywords. The file is named so as not to interfere with FILE_BASENAME,
;    which was introduced in IDL 6.0 and performs a similar function.

; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;    baseFilename = FSC_Base_Filename(thePath)
;
; INPUTS:
;
;    thePath:      This is the file path you wish to extract a base file name from.
;                  It is a string variable of the sort returned from Dialog_Pickfile.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;    DIRECTORY:    The directory information obtained from the input file path.
;                  The directory always ends in a directory separator character.
;
;    EXTENSION:    The file extension associated with the input file path.
;
; RETURN_VALUE:
;
;    baseFilename: The base filename, stripped of directory and file extension information.
